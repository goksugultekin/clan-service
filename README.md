Vertigo Games – Data Engineer Case Study

This repository contains my solution for the Vertigo Games Data Engineer Case, which consists of two main parts:

Part 1: Backend API for Clan Management

Part 2: Analytics Modeling with DBT & Business Visualization


***PART 1***

This document describes the complete implementation of Clan Service API, a lightweight backend designed to manage game clans.
It is built with FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and Docker, deployed on Google Cloud Run, using Cloud SQL for data storage.
All results are returned as JSON responses.

The goal of this project is to evaluate backend development skills, database design, and cloud-native deployment experience.

The API allows:

->Create a clan (with a name and region)

->List clans (with pagination)

->Find clans by name (min 3 letters, partial match)

->Delete a specific clan by ID

Each clan record has:
a unique UUID identifier (id)
a UTC timestamp (created_at) automatically generated on creation


Database Schema
CREATE TABLE clans (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    region VARCHAR(10),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);


.env file:
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_NAME=clandb
DB_HOST=db
DB_PORT=5432


docker compose up -d --build

docker ps
# clan_api and clan_postgres should both be "running"

Sample CSV: clan_sample_data.csv

docker exec -it clan_api python sample_data_loader.py

docker exec -it clan_postgres psql -U postgres -d clandb -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM clans;"

1️⃣ Create Clan

POST /clans
{
  "name": "DarkPhoenix",
  "region": "TR"
}


Response
{
  "id": "bb7cf17a-5ab1-4c62-89cc-7d8301bb76c9",
  "name": "DarkPhoenix",
  "region": "TR",
  "created_at": "2025-12-24T21:12:33Z"
}

2️⃣ List Clans
GET /clans?limit=50&offset=0
[
  {"name": "ShadowReavers", "region": "JP", "created_at": "2024-07-19T01:44:33Z"},
  {"name": "NightWatch", "region": "RU", "created_at": "2024-09-18T22:37:02Z"}
]


3️⃣ Search Clan by Name

GET /clans/search?name=dark
[
  {
    "id": "c50047ba-6ddd-4782-9a0e-7854c99b5e31",
    "name": "DarkVanguard",
    "region": "BR",
    "created_at": "2025-03-14T17:47:48Z"
  },
  {
    "id": "8d38f64c-ecb3-4334-ae71-dfa15f7b3996",
    "name": "DarkLight",
    "region": "DE",
    "created_at": "2024-09-09T18:36:52Z"
  }
]


4️⃣ Delete Clan by ID

DELETE /clans/{id}
{
  "status": "deleted",
  "id": "cd7e0a94-65c0-4f8c-854c-6b518348e02b"
}


☁️ Deployment on Google Cloud Run & Cloud SQL

Database
Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL 15) instance clan-sql with database clandb.

API Deployment
gcloud run deploy clan-api \
    --source . \
    --platform managed \
    --region europe-west1 \
    --add-cloudsql-instances clan-sql \
    --allow-unauthenticated


Public Endpoint
https://clan-api-xxxxxxxxxxxx.europe-west1.run.app/clans


Example SQL Queries (in Cloud SQL Studio)
SELECT name, region, created_at
FROM clans
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM clans;


Example CLI Usage
# List clans
curl "http://localhost:8000/clans?limit=10&offset=0" | jq .

# Search clan
curl "http://localhost:8000/clans/search?name=dark" | jq .

# Delete clan
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8000/clans/{id}" | jq .
